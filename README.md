Skinny
=========

Skinny is a lightweight tweakable block cipher which provides strong security guarantees against
common attack vectors. This is an implementation of Skinny for modern high-end platforms like Intel Haswell and Skylake. It utilizes the available SIMD instruction sets to achieve high
performance when processing multiple inputs.
